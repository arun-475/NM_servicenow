Introduction
This project focuses on enhancing project management efficiency by optimizing user, group, and role management through the implementation of access controls and automated workflows within the ServiceNow platform. Effective management of roles and access ensures secure, role-based permissions, reduces manual administrative effort, and improves compliance through audit-ready processes. The project showcases scalable automation that aligns with enterprise needs to streamline task assignments and accountability across project lifecycles.

Problem Statement
In a small project management team consisting of a Project Manager (Alice) and a Team Member (Bob), lack of clear role definitions, access controls, and structured workflows cause confusion in task assignments and progress tracking. The project aims to address this by defining precise roles, enforcing access control policies, and designing workflows that automate task lifecycle events.

Objective
Streamline user, group, and role management using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Automate approval workflows and access provisioning.

Ensure secure and compliant handling of project and task data.

Improve compliance, auditing, and operational efficiency.

Key Features
Import user, group, and role data via Import Sets and Transform Maps.

Enforce Access Control Lists (ACLs) for data security at the form, field, and table levels.

Automate workflows for role assignments and task approvals.

Build custom tables and roles tailored for project and task management.

Provide dynamic dashboards for real-time reporting.

Implement user impersonation for testing permissions and workflows.

Implementation
Creation and assignment of users, groups, and roles in ServiceNow.

Custom table creation for managing projects and tasks.

Detailed ACL configurations ensuring fine-grained access control.

Workflow design to automate task status updates and approval requests.

Testing through impersonation and role-based access verification.

Benefits
Clear accountability and task ownership.

Enhanced security and compliance via RBAC and ACLs.

Automated and transparent workflow processes.

Scalable management aligned with organizational needs.

Conclusion
Optimizing identity and access management in ServiceNow through user, group, and role configurations combined with robust workflows is vital for operational efficiency and data security. This project demonstrates how structured access controls and automated processes can reduce administrative burden, enforce compliance, and foster effective project delivery.
